Lecture: Numpy
Review Question 1
Which Numpy function do you use to create an array?
Answer : array()

Review Question 2
Which two statements describe the advantage of Numpy Package over regular Python Lists?
Answer : The Numpy Package provides the array, a data type that can be used to do element-wise calculations.
         Because Numpy arrays can only hold element of a single type, 
            calculations on Numpy arrays can be carried out way faster than regular Python lists.

Review Question 3
What is the resulting Numpy array z after executing the following lines of code?
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([3, 2, 1])
z = x + y
Answer : array([4, 4, 4])

Review Question 4
What happens when you put an integer, a Boolean, and a string in the same Numpy array using the array() function?
Answer : All array elements are converted to strings.

Lecture: 2D Numpy Arrays  
Review Question 1
What charaterizes multi-dimensional Numpy arrays?
Answer : You can create a 2D Numpy array from a regular list of lists.

Review Question 2
You created the following 2D Numpy array, x
:
import numpy as np
x = np.array([["a", "b", "c", "d"],
              ["e", "f", "g", "h"]])
Which Python command do you use to select the string "g" from x?
Answer : x[1,2]

Review Question 3
What does the resulting array z contain after executing the following lines of Python code?
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [1, 2, 3]])
y = np.array([[1, 1, 1],
              [1, 2, 3]])
z = x - y
Answer : array([[0, 1, 2],
                [0, 0, 0]])
       
Lecture: Basic Statistics with Numpy
Review Question 1
Which of the following statement about basic statistics with Numpy is correct?
Note: assume that the Numpy package is imported as np.
Answer : Numpy offers many functions to calculate basic statistics, such as np.mean(), np.median() and np.std(). 

Review Question 2
You are writing code to measure your travel time and weather conditions to work each day.
The data is recorded in a Numpy array where each row specifies the measurements for a single day.
The first column specifies the temperature in Fahrenheit. The second column specifies the amount of travel time in minutes.
The following is a sample of the code.
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[28, 18],
              [34, 14],
              [32, 16],
              ...
              [26, 23],
              [23, 17]])
Which Python command do you use to calculate the average travel time?
Answer : np.mean(x[:,1])

Review Question 3
As a wrap up, have a look at the statements below about Numpy in general. Select the three statements that hold.
Answer : Numpy is a great alternative to the regular Python list if you want to do Data Science in Python.
      Numpy arrays can only hold elements of the same basic type.
 Next to an efficient data structure, Numpy also offers tools to calculate summary statistics and to simulate statistical distributions.
